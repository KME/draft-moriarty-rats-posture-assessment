 Scalable Remote Attestation for Systems, Containers, and Applications
                 draft-moriarty-attestationsets-latest

Abstract

   This document establishes an architectural pattern whereby a remote
   attestation could be issued for a complete set of benchmarks or
   controls that are defined and grouped by an external entity,
   preventing the need to send over individual attestations for each
   item within a benchmark or control framework.  This document
   establishes a pattern to list sets of benchmarks and controls within
   CWT and JWT formats for use as an Entity Attestation Token (EAT).

1.  Introduction

   Posture assessment has long been desired, but has been difficult to
   achieve due to complexities of customization requirements at each
   organization.  By using policy and measurement sets that may be
   offered at various assurance levels defined in an Entity Attestation
   Token (EAT) profile [I-D.ietf-rats-eat], automating posture
   assessment through attestation becomes achievable for organizations
   of all sizes.  The measurement and policy groupings in an EAT profile
   may be provided by the vendor or by a neutral third party to enable
   ease of use and consistent implementations.  This provides simpler
   options to enable posture assessment at selected levels by
   organizations without the need to have in-house expertise.  The
   measurement and policy sets may also be customized, but not necessary
   to achieve posture assessment to predefined options.  This document
   describes a method to use existing attestation formats and protocols
   while allowing for defined profiles of policies, benchmarks, and
   measurements for specific assurance levels that scale to provide
   transparency to posture assessment results summarized with remote
   attestation.

   By way of example, the Center for Internet Security (CIS) hosts
   recommended configuration settings to secure operating systems,
   applications, and devices in CIS Benchmarks developed with industry
   experts.  Attestations aligned to the CIS Benchmarks or other
   configuration guide such as a DISA STIG could be used to assert the
   configuration meets expectations.  This has already been done for
   multiple platforms to demonstrate assurance for firmware according to
   NIST SP 800-193, Firmware Resiliency Guidelines.  In order to scale
   remote attestation, a single attestation for a set of Benchmarks or
   policies being met may be sent to the remote atteststaion management
   system.  On traditional servers, assurance to NIST SP 800-193 is
   provable through attestation from a root of trust (RoT), using the
   Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip and
   attestation formats.

   At boot, policy and measurement expectations are verified against a
   set of "golden policies" from collected and attested evidence.
   Device identity and measurements can also be attestated at runtime.
   The attestations on evidence (e.g. hash of boot element) and
   verification of attestations are typically contained within a system
   and are limited to the control plane for management.  The policy and
   measurement sets for comparison are protected to assure the result in
   the attestation verification process for boot element.  Event logs
   and PCR values may be exposed to provide transparency into the
   verified attestations.  Remote attestation provides a summary of a
   local assessment of posture for managed systems and across various
   layers (operating system, application, containers) in each of these
   systems in a managed environment.

   There is a balance of exposure and evidence needed to assess posture
   when providing assurance of controls and system state.  Currently,
   logs and TPM PCR values may be passed to provide assurance of
   verification of attestation evidence meeting set requirements.
   Providing the assurance can be accomplished with a remote attestation
   format such as the Entity Attestation Token (EAT) [I-D.ietf-rats-eat]
   and a RESTful interface such as ROLIE or RedFish.  Policy definition
   blocks may be scoped to control measurement sets, where the EAT
   profile asserts compliance to the policy or measurement block
   specified and may include claims with the log and PCR value evidence.
   Measurement and Policy sets in an EAT profile may be published and
   maintained by separate entities (e.g.  CIS Benchmarks, DISA STIGs).
   The policy and measurement sets should be maintained separately even
   if associated with the same benchmark or control set.  This avoids
   the need to transition the verifying entity to a remote system for
   individual policy and measurements which are performed locally for
   more immediate remediation as well as other functions.

   Examples of measurement and policy sets that could be defined in EAT
   profiles include, but are not limited to:

   *  Hardware attribute certificates, TCG

   *  Hardware Attribute Certificate Comparison Results, TCG

   *  Reference Integrity Measurements for firmware, TCG

   *  Operating system benchmarks at Specified Assurance Levels, CIS

   *  Application hardening Benchmarks at Specified Assurance Levels,
      CIS, DISA STIG

   *  Container security benchmarks at Specified Assurance Levels, CIS

   Scale, ease of use, full automation, and consistency for customer
   consumption of a remote attestation function or service are essential
   toward the goal of consistently securing systems against known
   threats and vulnerabilities.  Mitigations may be baked into policy.
   Claim sets of measurements and policy verified to meet or not meet
   Endorsed values [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] are conveyed in an Entity
   Attestation Token made available to a RESTful interface in aggregate
   for the systems managed.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Policy and Measurement Set Definitions

   This document defines EAT claims in the JWT [RFC7519] and CWT
   [RFC8392] registries to provide attestation to a set of verified
   claims within a defined grouping.  The trustworthiness will be
   conveyed on original verified evidence as well as the attestation on
   the grouping.

   +=======+============================+====================+========+
   | Claim | Long Name                  | Description        | Format |
   +=======+============================+====================+========+
   | MPS   | Measurement or Policy Set  | Name for the MPS   |        |
   +-------+----------------------------+--------------------+--------+
   | LEM   | Log Evidence of MPS        | Log File or URI    |        |
   +-------+----------------------------+--------------------+--------+
   | PCR   | TPM PCR Values             | URI                |        |
   +-------+----------------------------+--------------------+--------+
   | FMA   | Format of MPS Attestations | Format of included |        |
   |       |                            | attestations       |        |
   +-------+----------------------------+--------------------+--------+
   | HSH   | Hash Value/Message Digest  | Hash value of      |        |
   |       |                            | claim-set          |        |
   +-------+----------------------------+--------------------+--------+

4.  Supportability and Re-Attestation

   The remote attestation framework shall include provisions within the
   system and attestation authority to allow for Product modification.

   Over its lifecycle, the Product may experience modification due to:
   maintenance, failures, upgrades, expansion, moves, etc..

   The customer can chose to:

   *  Run remote attestation after product modification, or

   *  Not take action and remain un-protected

   In the case of Re-Attestation:

   *  framework needs to invalidate previous TPM PCR values and tokens,

   *  framework needs to collect new measurements,

   *  framework needs to maintain history or allow for history to be
      logged to enable change traceability attestation, and

   *  framework needs to notify that the previous attestation has been
      invalidated

5.  Configuration Sets

   In some cases, it may be difficult to attest to configuration
   settings for the initial or subsequent attestation and verification
   processes.  The use of an expected hash value for configuration
   settings can be used to compare the attested configuration set.  In
   this case, the creator of the attestation verification measurements
   would define a set of values for which a message digest would be
   created and then signed by the attestor.  The expected measurements
   would include the expected hash value for comparison.  The
   configuration set could be the full attestation set to a Benchmark or
   a defined subset.

6.  Remediation

   If policy and configration settings or measurements attestated do not
   meet expected values, remediation is desireable.  Automated
   remediation performed with alignment to zero trust architecture
   principles would require that the remeidation be performed prior to
   any relying component executing.  The relying component would verifiy
   before continuing in a zero trust architecture.

   Ideally, remediation would occur on system as part of the process to
   attest to a set of attestations, similar to how attestation is
   performed for firmware in the boot process.  If automated remediation
   is not possible, an alert should be generated to allow for
   notification of the variance from expected values.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document establishes a pattern to list sets of benchmarks and
   controls within CWT and JWT formats.  The contents of the benchmarks
   and controls are out of scope for this document.  This establishes an
   architectural pattern whereby a remote attestation could be issued
   for a complete set of benchmarks or controls as defined and grouped
   by external entities, preventing the need to send over individual
   attestations for each item within a benchmark or control framework.
   This document does not add security consideration over what has been
   described in the EAT, JWT, or CWT specifications.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA, yet.  This will list the
   initial registration sets to the JWT and CWT registries if adopted.
   The registry will contain the names of the Benchmarks, Policy sets,
   DISA STIGS, controls, or other groupings of policy and measurements
   to map the standards document to a claim set for verification.
